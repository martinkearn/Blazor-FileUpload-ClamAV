<h1>File Upload with BlazorInputFile and ClamAV/nClam</h1>

<p>This sample combines <a href="https://blog.stevensanderson.com/2019/09/13/blazor-inputfile/">BlazorInputFile</a> with <a href="https://github.com/tekmaven/nClam">nClam</a> to do a file upload with virus check against <a href="https://www.clamav.net/">ClamAV</a> server instance hosted via a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/filefrog/clamav">filefrog/clamav</a> Docker container.</p>

<InputFile OnChange="HandleFileSelected" />

@if (file != null)
{
    <p>Name: @file.Name</p>
    <p>Size bytes before scan: @file.Size</p>
    <p>Last modified date: @file.LastModified.ToShortDateString()</p>
    <p>Content type (not always supplied by the browser): @file.Type</p>
    <p>ClamAV scan status: @scanStatus</p>
    <p>File bytes after scan: @bytesAfterScan</p>

@code {
    IFileListEntry file;
    string scanStatus;
    int bytesAfterScan;

    private async Task HandleFileSelected(IFileListEntry[] files)
    {
        file = files.FirstOrDefault();

        // file.Data is a non-seekable stream. This means it can only be read once and the ClamAV scan counts as a read.
        // To mitigate this, you need to store the file somehwere on the first read from the InputFile component and send that version to ClamAV.
        // For simplicity I'm going to simply store it in memory as a byte[], but this is not a practical solution because several large files being stored concurrently could take up all your server memory.
        // A better, more scalable solution would be to store the file in a Azure Storage Blob Container and send it to ClamAV from there. I may update the sample later to show this.

        // Read the file stream into byte[] in server memory. This byte[] can then be used to work with the file after the ClamAV scan has taken place
        using var memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
        await file.Data.CopyToAsync(memoryStream);
        var fileBytes = memoryStream.ToArray();

        // Scan with nClam
        var serverName = Configuration["ClamAVServerName"];
        var clam = new ClamClient(serverName, 3310);
        var scanResult = await clam.SendAndScanFileAsync(fileBytes);
        scanStatus = scanResult.Result switch
        {
            ClamScanResults.Unknown => $"File scan produced an unknown status from {serverName}, {scanResult.RawResult}",
            ClamScanResults.Clean => $"CLEAN according to {serverName}",
            ClamScanResults.VirusDetected => $"INFECTED according to {serverName}",
            ClamScanResults.Error => $"File scan produced an error from {serverName}, {scanResult.RawResult}",
        };


        // Do something else with the file
        bytesAfterScan = fileBytes.Length;
